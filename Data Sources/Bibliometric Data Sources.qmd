## Data Sources

-   Web of Science (selective)

-   Scopus (selective)

-   Google Scholar (online articles/inclusive)

-   Open Alex (online articles/inclusive)

-   PubMed (Medicine, exhaustive)

-   CRossref (DOI)

-   Dimensions (Crossref + PubMed)

# Comparison of Sources

## Web of Science

-   Also known as Institute for Scientific Information, Web of Science, Web of Knowledge, Thomson Reuters, Thomson Scientific

-   It was the first index of scientific citations, created in 1961 as the **Science Citation Index**

-   Journals are added to the index based on their citations

## Scopus (Elsevier)

-   Created in 2004 as a vertical integration of Elsevier

-   Better author dissambiguation

## Google Scholar

-   Tries to cover all online articles

-   Disambiguation of authors by authors themselves

-   Data is gathered automatically, no quality controls.

-   This implies that data is low quality and easily manipulable

-   There is no accessible database

## Google Scholar

## PubMed

-   Public, [and free]{.underline}

-   Aims to cover all medical literature

-   MeSH headings (high quality tags)

## Dimensions

-   Created in 208

-   Free for research in some cases

-   Doesn't have quality criteria for inclusion (like WoS), it is based on DOI (crossref data)

-   Good data on institutions, funding agencies, and grants

## Open Alex

-   Started as Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG), to compete with Google Scholar

-   MAG was a massive database available for free bulk download

-   When MAG was discontinued (2021) Open Alex was created.

-   Has similar problems to Google Scholar, but it is in constant improvement.
